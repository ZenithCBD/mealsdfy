# Hello! Thanks for checking out the MealsDFY code.
# I'm not sure how good it will be, this is
# my first project ever, and I'm excited
# to show you all what I've got!

# I've tried to leave lots of comments, and the variables and functions
# should be very self explanatory.
# _--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--_--

# First, we begin by defining the class Meals,
# the plan being we can just call each meal in meals
# as an individual instance

class Meals:
  # Meals has 3 attributes, initialized and defined here
  def __init__(self, name, ingredients, instructions)
    self.name = name
    self.ingredients = ingredients[]
    self.instructions = instructions[]
    # self.mood = mood       # This will be used to separate the themes of food, like breakfasts from snacks

# I shall return later to make this actually functional
# goals:
# 1) display a list of meal options for a specific mood when prompted
# 2) 

# Hey in-tents, it's in-tents. You are really stoned rn, so I'm leaving this note cuz I won't remember.
# I just realized we can group all the subclasses (like snacks and desserts) into meals (Breakfasts and Postnoons).
# We just need to add a mood attribute.
